description: "Compatibility workspace skill for the TallerGitHub repository when a user or IDE refers to the repository Skills folder. Use for the same IBM i TallerGitHub work as tallergithub-ibmi: SQLRPGLE/RPGLE modules, service programs, SQL table/view scripts, IFS JSON reconciliation output, PUB400 setup, TOBi/makei build configuration, and agent review reports based on Documentacion_IBMi/Requerimientos/requerimientos_taller.md and Reglas/Revision_IBMi.md."

# TallerGitHub Skills Compatibility

Use this as a compatibility alias for the repository-local TallerGitHub IBM i skill.

Prefer the canonical workspace skill `tallergithub-ibmi` when invoking skills directly. If an IDE or prompt refers to the repository `Skills` folder, apply these same rules.

## Core Workflow

1. Read and validate relevant repository files before editing:
   - `Documentacion_IBMi/Requerimientos/requerimientos_taller.md`
   - `Reglas/Revision_IBMi.md`
   - `Documentacion_IBMi/Base_Datos/estructura_bd.md`
   - `Databases/GLBLN.SQL` when GLBLN fields or SQL scripts are involved
   - `.vscode/actions.json`, `.vscode/tasks.json`, `iproj.json`, and `Rules.mk` when PUB400, TOBi/makei, compile actions, or environment setup are involved
2. Preserve the IBM i architecture:
   - Main SQLRPGLE program orchestrates the process.
   - Data access is separated from business rules.
   - Reconciliation rules are separated from JSON/IFS output.
   - Reusable utilities belong in modules or service programs.
3. Keep all outputs traceable by execution id, timestamp, program, library, user, and IFS path.
4. Validate JSON output against the reconciliation contract documented in `Documentacion_IBMi/Requerimientos/requerimientos_taller.md`.
5. When reviewing, lead with findings ordered by severity and cite files or sections as evidence.

## Implementation Guidance

- Use `GLBLN`, defined in `Databases/GLBLN.SQL`, as the primary source for general ledger account balances.
- Support filters for bank, branch, currency, account range, process date, output IFS path, and execution mode.
- Generate UTF-8 JSON in IFS with `metadata`, `ejecucion`, `contexto`, `cuentas`, `controlTotales`, and `incidentes`.
- Include source, calculated, and reconciled balances for each account.
- Include reconciliation items when differences exist.
- Mark `excedeTolerancia` and `requiereRevision` explicitly.
- Set execution status to `PARCIAL` or `ERROR` when high-severity incidents require it.
- Keep PUB400 constraints in mind: personal library, SQL tables/views only, no DDS PF/LF objects.

## SQL DDL Rules

For table scripts, enforce the TallerGitHub SQL standard:

- Use `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE`.
- Define system column aliases with `FOR COLUMN`.
- Define a `PRIMARY KEY` with `CONSTRAINT`.
- Define `RCDFMT`.
- Include real, non-placeholder metadata header values.
- Include `COMMENT ON TABLE` and `LABEL ON TABLE`.
- Include `COMMENT ON COLUMN`, `LABEL ON COLUMN`, and `LABEL ON COLUMN ... TEXT IS` for every column.
- Do not create PF or LF objects, and do not use DDS artifacts.

## Review Guidance

Use the TallerGitHub severity model:

- Critical: incorrect data, integrity loss, major functional noncompliance, severe vulnerability, invalid required JSON, PF/LF creation, or missing main-flow test evidence.
- High: operationally relevant failure, no component separation, monolithic critical code, or incomplete table metadata/comments.
- Medium: maintainability/design issues, inconsistent naming, accumulated technical debt.
- Low: improvement with no immediate functional impact.

Decision rules:

- `Aprobado`: no Critical/High findings and test evidence exists.
- `Aprobado con observaciones`: only Medium/Low findings with a correction plan.
- `Rechazado`: any Critical finding, any High finding that blocks compliance, or missing minimum test evidence.
